  uid: string,           // Firebase Auth UID
  email: string,
  role: 'teacher' | 'student',
  profile: {
    firstName: string,
    lastName: string,
    avatar?: string,
  },
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

#### Classes Collection
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  teacherId: string,     // Reference to teacher
  name: string,
  code: string,          // Unique class code
  description?: string,
  schedule: {
    days: string[],      // ['monday', 'wednesday', 'friday']
    time: string,        // '09:00'
    duration: number,    // in minutes
  },
  room: string,
  students: string[],    // Array of student UIDs
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

#### Attendance Collection
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  classId: string,
  studentId: string,
  teacherId: string,
  checkInTime: timestamp,
  nfcId?: string,        // NFC tag identifier
  status: 'present' | 'late' | 'absent',
  date: string,          // YYYY-MM-DD format
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```
